<p>
Build-a-Coin is a generator of <a href="http://weusecoins.com">Bitcoin</a>-derived cryptocurrencies (BDCs) or "altcoins".
Given a selection of parameters, Build-a-Coin produces the source code for a new and unique coin.

<a name="why-should-i-trust-this-service" href="#why-should-i-trust-this-service"><h3>Why should I trust this service?</h3></a>
<p>
You shouldn't.  The simplest check is to download the original source your coin
was templated from and compare the two.  Carefully consider any differences you
find.

<a name="how-do-i-with-my-new-coin" href="#how-do-i-with-my-new-coin"><h3>How do I . . . with my new coin?</h3></a>
<p>
You'll need to set up at least two nodes, connect them with the
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list">addnode</a>
function and start mining.
</p>
<p>
Once you have some stable nodes, you'll probably want to add those nodes' IP
addresses to the code as bootstrap nodes, otherwise all your users will have to
addnode you before they can do anything.

<p>
Beyond those starting pointers, you'll need to look elsewhere for help.
<a href="https://bitcointalk.org">Bitcoin Talk</a> and the
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page">Bitcoin Wiki</a> are good
resources.

<a name="what-codebase-are-buildacoin-bdcs-based-on" href="#what-codebase-are-buildacoin-bdcs-based-on"><h3>What codebase are Build-a-Coin coins based on?</h3></a>
<p>
Currently, all Build-a-Coin coins are derived from <a href="https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/tree/v0.8.5.1">Litecoin 0.8.5.1</a>.
</p>

<a name="why-litecoin" href="#why-litecoin"><h3>Why Litecoin?</h3></a>
<p>
Litecoin is the most popular basis of manually-derived coins.

<a name="how-is-the-genesis-block-mined-so-fast" href="#how-is-the-genesis-block-mined-so-fast"><h3>How is the genesis block mined so fast?</h3></a>
<p>
Build-a-Coin coins differ from bitcoin in that they do not verify the
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work">proof of work</a> (PoW) of the genesis block.
Because the genesis block is hard-coded into the client, no other proof of legitimacy is required, and skipping the genesis block PoW check
allows coins to be produced on-demand without any initial mining.  Mining of blocks after the genesis block is normal.
</p>

<a name="who-gets-the-genesis-block-reward" href="#who-gets-the-genesis-block-reward"><h3>Who gets the genesis block reward?</h3></a>
<p>
No one.  The public key that the reward of the genesis block is paid to is
random and the output is therefore unspendable.  Even if a public key with a
known private key were inserted, all coins including bitcoin itself do not allow
the reward of the genesis block to be spent.
</p>

<a name="if-i-enter-the-same-values-will-i-get-the-same-output" href="#if-i-enter-the-same-values-will-i-get-the-same-output"><h3>If I enter the same values will I get the same output?</h3></a>
<p>
No.  The genesis block of each coin is based on the time of generation as well a
random nonce and coinbase output pubkey.  Outside of the genesis block the code
will be the same, but different genesis block means different currency.
</p>

<a name="what-are-alert-signing-pubkeys" href="#what-are-alert-signing-pubkeys"><h3>What are alert signing pubkeys?</h3></a>
<p>
Bitcoin has a mechanism for warning users about important incidents like the
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_50">march 2013 bitcoin fork</a>.
By default, Build-a-Coin coins have null alert pubkeys so no one may send alerts
for them.  If you want to be able to alert your coin's users, generate a
bitcoin-compatible ECDSA keypair or keypairs and use the hex-encoded public
keys.

<p>
No.
