Build-a-Coin tries to cut down on compile errors by rejecting inputs that would
break your new coin.  Limitations on input values are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>All strings must contain only
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters">ASCII printable characters</a>.</li>
    <li>All string values must not contain quotes <code>["']</code> nor backslashes
    <code>[\]</code>.</li>
    <li>All strings must be no more than 256 bytes long</li>
    <li>The name and currency code must consist only alphabetical
    characters <code>[a-zA-Z]</code>.</li>
    <li>Numeric values must fit into the datatype they will be in your coin's
    code.  Errors in numeric fields probably mean they're too big or
    negative.</li>
    <li>Pubkeys must be 65 bytes expressed in hexadecimal (130 hex digits)</li>
</ul>

Build-a-Coin attempts to always produce correct code.  If you haven't edited
your code at all and have ruled out a build system misconfiguration, please
email
<a href="mailto:info+buildacoin@shick.xyz">info+buildacoin@shick.xyz</a> with the following:
<ul>
    <li>your coin's build-a-coin.txt or coin identifier</li>
    <li>operating system version</li>
    <li>compiler version</li>
</ul>
It is the policy of Build-a-Coin that if a coin compiles on our build platform
(Debian/gcc), then it is working.  Although Build-a-Coin coins should compile
anywhere bitcoin can be compiled, we do not guarantee this.

If you put unreasonable values in, you'll get an unreasonable coin out.
Build-a-Coin coins have been tested for correctness with reasonable inputs, but
are not guaranteed to work.  If you believe you've found a bug in Build-a-Coin
itself, report it to <a href="mailto:info+buildacoin@shick.xyz">info+buildacoin@shick.xyz</a>.

Build-a-Coin does not provide any support for the compilation process; there
are many guides freely available that cover this topic.

for a walk-through of getting your coin up and running.
